# ShawnlouwAddedThisLine_ADD_YOURS
1. Step one - I've push this to main branch. Now I'm going to create a new branch called collaboration.
2. In collaboration, I will write another line an push to collaboration and check if the changes will appear here on the main branch or will be on hold, coz we have to merge the changes after that for them to appear, according to my knowledge.
